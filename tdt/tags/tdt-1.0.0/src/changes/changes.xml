        <release version="1.0.0" date="2012-02-01" description="Feature Release">
            <action dev="floerkem" type="add" due-to="Mark Harrison">
                Upgrade to TDT Specification 1.6
            </action>
            <action dev="floerkem" type="add" due-to="Mark Harrison">
                Updates to TDTEngine.java to better handle escaped characters in URIs as well as situations where multiple prefixMatch values appear to match 
                (the problem was introduced because bare 00 and 01 in ELEMENT_STRING level match any header beginning with 00 or 01, so in these situations we now need to examine the pattern regexes to determine which scheme and level
                actually matches the regex)
            </action>
        </release>
