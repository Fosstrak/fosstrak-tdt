Welcome to the Accada Tag Data Translation Project


* Objective

     An EPC identifier may be expressed in a number of representations or encodings, such as BINARY, tag-encoding URI, pure-identity URI, legacy formats
     
     The objective of the Tag Data Translation (TDT) is to provide flexible translation (encoding/decoding) between these different representations of an EPC. For example, TDT allows a binary string to be converted into a URI representation or vice versa.
     The coding schemes specified in {{{http://www.epcglobalinc.org} EPCglobal Tag Data Standards v1.27}} are supported in v1.0 of Tag Data Translation.

* Status

   There is an implementation available for {{{download.html} download}}. 

 
* Organization
  
  
  The TDT project consists of two modules:
  
  * the TDTEngine (library for performing conversion)
  
  * TDTFrontEnd (a test client that uses TDTEngine to perform conversions)
  
  TDTEngine makes use of the XML schema and instance files defined in EPCglobal Tag Data Translation v1.0
  
  
  
* Usage Scenarios
  
  Possible usage scenarios include the following:
  
  * Convert a binary EPC string read from a tag into a tag-encoding URI for use with ALE
  
  []  
  * Convert a binary EPC string read from a tag into a pure-identity URI for use with EPCIS
  
  []
  * Convert a binary EPC string into a legacy format (e.g. GTIN + serial number) for use with legacy applications
  
  []
  * Convert an EPC into a hostname, to be looked up in order to perform an ONS query.  (N.B.  ONS currently only supports SGTIN)
  
  []
  * Convert an EPC into a binary format, for writing an EPC onto a tag
  
  []
